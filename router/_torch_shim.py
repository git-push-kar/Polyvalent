"""Windows-CPU hardening: torch.compile -> eager no-op when inductor is broken.

transformers' ModernBERT uses @torch.compile at class-definition time, which
imports torch._inductor -> stale triton and crashes on boxes where triton
can't install (win/py3.12). Inductor can't run on Windows-CPU anyway, so
eager is behavior-preserving for inference. Import this BEFORE laya.
